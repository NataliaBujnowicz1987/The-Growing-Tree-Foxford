            <h2>Curriculum Statement</h2>
            <div class="service-box">
                <p>The Growing Tree is committed to providing a curriculum that supports children’s development through
                    an emerging inquiry based curriculum. This mode of curriculum is underpinned by Aistear- The
                    National Early Childhood Curriculum Framework, Siolta -The National Quality Framework for Early
                    Childhood Education. </p><br />
                <p>The curriculum supports children’s learning and development. Observations determine children’s
                    interests and abilities leading practitioners to plan activities and provide materials that engage
                    children, build on existing skills and provide a platform for new learning. This model empowers
                    children promoting partnership and allows for all children’s development. Children are supported and
                    encouraged to share their voice, gain independence, become problem solvers, decision makers, be
                    creative, persistent, curious and to be respectful of themselves and others through positive and
                    reciprocal interactions from educators. Early years educators provide an appropriate environment,
                    that provides timely interventions, support and continuity to promote positive attitudes towards
                    learning and life. </p><br />
                <p>Aistear – Aistear is comprised of four themes. Communication, Identity and Belonging, Well-Being and
                    Exploring and Thinking. Within these four areas are a multiple of aims and goals which provide a
                    framework to guide children’s practice which facilitates learning. </p><br />
                <p>Siolta- Siolta is comprised of 12 principles. It is designed to define, assess and support the
                    improvement of quality across all aspects of practice in early childhood and education settings for
                    children from 0-6 years of age.</p><br />
                <p>The Growing Tree recognizes parents and families as being children’s first educators and the most
                    important people in their lives. The care and education children receive from their parents and
                    family in their formative years greatly influences their overall development. Children’s extended
                    family and community also share a role in children’s development and education. We respect
                    children’s background and culture. We give parents opportunities for parents to share information
                    about their child from outside of the service and share ideas which we can introduce into the
                    playroom. Working with parents supports relationships with children and families that are respectful
                    and inclusive, promoting learning and development.</p><br />
                <p>Building positive relationships with children is integral to their learning and development. Learning
                    is acquired through interactions between the child and early years educator. Interactions can be led
                    by either the child or adult. Learning is enhanced through having a respectful understanding of the
                    child, their uniqueness, experiences, abilities and needs. Key workers are assigned to children for
                    the purpose of observing, planning for groups and gaining a deeper understanding of the child, this
                    ensures children’s needs are met and practices put in place to support the learning and development
                    of the individual.</p><br />
                <p>Our curriculum supports children’s well-being, encourages feelings of safety, trust and emotional
                    security to children and their families. It meets all of the requirements of Aistear and engages
                    children in a holistic approach to learning and life.</p>

            <h2>What Our Day Looks Like</h2>
            <div class="service-box">

                <p><b>Dropping off your Child</b></p>
                <i class="fas fa-car-side"></i>
                <p> Children and parents are greeted each morning by a staff member, if you have any information you
                    need to give staff for the day ahead, this is a good time. Children are supported in their
                    transition each day and staff will work with parents to find ways to help settle a reserved child.
                    Children are encouraged to be independent hanging up coats, putting lunches into trolley. Children
                    are encouraged to get materials for themselves and communicate their needs and wants. Staff are
                    experienced in picking up on non-verbal cues from children. Children are encouraged to be
                    independent as much as possible but are given help when necessary, this is always in line with the
                    childs age and ability.</p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Choice Time</b></p>
                <i class="fas fa-box-open"></i>
                <p>Choice time gives children opportunity to choose materials and activities that they want to explore
                    and engage with this can last between 50 minutes to an hour and a half depending on the level of
                    involvement of the children, this is a time for adults to move around the room and interact with
                    different children and engage in their activities at a level where the child is the leader in the
                    play.
                    Adults use this time to engage children in interactions and conversations to support the learning
                    that is taking place this applies to all aspects of a childs play, learning can always happen. Staff
                    ensure they do not take over the play but become equal partners in play, this supports and
                    recognizes the ‘voice’ of the child and encourages the child to be and active partner in learning.
                    At the end of this period staff use a sand timer to show the children that this part of the day is
                    over the sand timer gives children time to have a last minute play before tidy up and prepare them
                    for transition. Children are encouraged to tidy away one activity before moving on this encourages
                    children to be responsible. At the end of this period staff use a sand timer to show the children
                    that this part of the day is over the sand timer gives children time to have a few more minutes to
                    play before tidy up and prepares them for transition. At the end of this period all children are
                    encouraged to help tidy all materials and toys away, this helps children become involved in
                    classroom community and have a shared responsibility, it also indicates that it is a time for a
                    transition.
                </p>
                <p>All of the rooms have their own way and times for when different routines take place but each room is
                    consistent in what they do. All of the rooms have small and large group times, some days having one
                    of either or perhaps both depending on the needs of the children on the particular day. </p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Small Group</b></p>
                <i class="fas fa-child"></i>
                <p>Small group consists of the coming together of a group of children and joining a key worker for an
                    activity based on the childrens interests these are variable and are planned to engage all the
                    abilities of the children in the group. These activities are planned from observations made by the
                    key worker on what children are currently interested in, the aim being to provide an activity which
                    will engage the children while providing a platform for personal development and learning. Also,
                    small group can be used to introduce a new topic that is relevant for the children development or
                    well-being. Again a sand timer is used to alert children to a transition.</p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Large Group</b></p>
                <i class="fas fa-users"></i>
                <p>Large group consists of all staff members joining with the children to engage in an activity that all
                    children and adults take part in, this is also based on children’s interests or can be used to
                    introduce something that is relevant and promotes the development and well-being of the children.
                    Sand timers are used to signal an impending transition.</p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Lunchtime</b> </p>
                <i class="fas fa-carrot"></i>
                <p>Children are encouraged to wash their hands and find a seat for lunch, children may be chosen to hand
                    out lunches as children get older they are encouraged to recognize their lunchbox, bring it to the
                    table and collect their drink. After lunch children are encouraged to tidy up, get their coat, take
                    off shoes and place together before getting their wellies (on wet days). Children are encouraged to
                    be independent, children’s ages and abilities are all different and each room works with their group
                    of children. Younger children will require a lot more help than older children.</p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Outdoor time </b></p>
                <i class="fas fa-cloud-sun"></i>
                <p>Children have lots of opportunity in the outdoor area to engage in physical play. Outdoor play is
                    important for children’s development and well-being. Children have opportunity to run, climb, slide,
                    play ball, use sand house, ride bikes and tractors and have the use of a polytunnel. The children
                    may not have all of these things every day. Children play out every day, we have shelters for wetter
                    weather where children can have toys from the shed to play with. Adults remain engaged and available
                    to children while ensuring their safety. A bell indicates time to return to the playrooms.</p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Home time</b></p>
                <i class="fas fa-home"></i>
                <p>Each room has their own routine for getting ready for home. Children are aware parents/minders are
                    coming at this time and can be very excited, staff are aware of this and the priority is to keep
                    children as calm as possible and for all children to leave the room in a safe manner. Staff will do
                    their best to have a few words as children leave, however this is not always possible. Staff may
                    need to speak to you, if it’s not possible at this time staff will ring you after the session. </p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Note</b></p>
                <i class="fas fa-pencil-alt"></i>
                <p>Depending on the room and the children attending the room, routines may differ, all except hometime.
                    If at any time you need to discuss your child please make an appointment by ringing the service to
                    do so. If you need to speak to a staff member urgently let the staff member know and they will do
                    their best to accommodate you.</p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Observations</b></p>
                <i class="far fa-eye"></i>
                <p>Observations are recorded and photographs taken during the day by staff. These are to facilitate
                    planning and for reflection on children’s learning. Parents receive child observations each month
                    and phots and descriptions are placed in the hall way for parents and families to share.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Areas of Learning- Aistear</h2>
            <div class="service-box">
                <p><b>Theme 1 - Well-Being</b></p>
                <p>
                    Childrens well-being is critical for a child to be happy and content. At The Growing Tree we provide
                    early experiences to promote positive mental health and emotional well-being. Emotional well- being
                    impacts on childrens well-being and the ability to learn. Having positive interactions with families
                    and children promotes trust and confidence. Through positive interactions, conflict resolution and
                    being respectful of each other, promote values that enable children to be emotionally and sociably
                    responsive.
                    Enabling children to have a sense of their own self-worth, encouraging them to believe in their own
                    uniqueness, how special they are and enabling them to recognise and express their feelings while
                    becoming more in tune with other people’s feelings. To do this staff engage children with activities
                    to support their understanding of feelings, to communicate physical sensations that accompany
                    emotions while helping them to learn positive strategies to overcome negative emotions. Children are
                    actively involved in discussion and participation through art, stories and role play.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Theme 2 – Identity and Belonging</b></p>
                <p>Children have their earliest experiences from within the family and parents are respected as
                    childrens first educators. It is a huge step into the world when children begin their educational
                    journey. Parents are a valued partner with The Growing Tree and can help us to support their child
                    through interactions giving information and being involved, this may be coming in for a morning to
                    engage in an activity with children, coming in for a sing song or having positive interactions with
                    staff. When children see parents interested in their education they see the value of learning.
                    Children learn about themselves and their increasing abilities and begin to gert a sense of the
                    bigger world.

                    The wider community provides a cultural background that helps children learn about who they are and
                    what is in their locality and how it involves them, this can be as basic as Mammy or Daddy working
                    in the local bakery this can provide a wealth of information and opportunities to support the childs
                    interests and learning, places children are familiar with, for example a discussion about the bridge
                    over the river gives opportunity for a platform, from which a rich learning experiences can occur
                    that leads to increased knowledge and understanding.
                </p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Theme 3 - Exploring and Thinking</b></p>
                <p>Children are explorers and are naturally inquisitive about their world, how it works and why.
                    Children explore using all of their senses, this leads to thoughts, ideas, investigations and
                    questions. At The Growing Tree children are encouraged and supported to explore their world to
                    discover how things work and why. Children are encouraged to think and ask questions and find
                    solutions based on their theories as to the how, whys and what’s. Adults support children through
                    open ended materials, opportunities and questions to encourage self-directed learning, this enables
                    children to work in partnership with staff while developing dispositions such as curiosity,
                    creativity, resilience, responsibility, problem solving, perseverance, independence, being
                    interested etc etc. Children are encouraged to explore and think through all areas of learning
                    including science, mathematical concepts, geography, history, arts and crafts, literacy and the
                    natural environment.</p>

                <p><b>Theme 4 - Communicating</b></p>
                <p>Communication occurs through many mediums from language and literacy to singing, rhymes, role play,
                    art and craft, role play, building. Children use different methods to communicate their ideas, at
                    The Growing Tree we encourage and respond through the provision of engaging materials to help
                    children pursue and develop their interests. </p>
                <br />

                <p><b>Language, Literacy and Numeracy</b></p>
                <p>Language, literacy and numeracy are embedded in all four themes.
                    Children develop language both verbally and non-verbally from a very young age. Children need
                    language in order to develop literacy skills. Literacy emerges gradually over time during the early
                    years. Literacy is the integration of listening, speaking, reading and writing this takes shape
                    through mark making, drawing, ‘reading books’ looking at print etc. Reading and writing begin with
                    learning language, in The Growing Tree we use many forms of play based activities to provide a
                    platform for each child to learn at his or her own pace. The emphasis is on learning through play
                    that is shared with children through their interests. Supportive relationships that emerge with
                    staff and continued observation of each child ensures staff within the setting provide materials and
                    activities to support the child’s emerging language, literacy and numeracy development.
                    Numeracy is more than counting, it is gaining the ability to use mathematical understanding and
                    skills to solve problems and learn to think and communicate quantitatively, to make sense of data,
                    gain spatial awareness, and to gain an understanding of when mathematical reasoning can be applied.
                    The Growing Tree aims to provide children with many opportunities to engage and enhance these early
                    mathematical concepts based on children’s interests and abilities.
                    Improved communication and oral language skills of young children, underpins their development of
                    literacy and the concept of mathematical ideas and language. This supports children’s life- long
                    benefits for the child, family and wider community.
